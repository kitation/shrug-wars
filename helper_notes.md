# Helper notes

Thank you for helping me deliver this workshop!

## The structure of the evening

First off we will be making sure everyone has Ruby and Git installed. Some people may need help with this if they haven't done it beforehand.

There are three parts of the workshop. First a little intro to what we are making (see the README), then there is a script for people to work on in pairs or individually. This covers arrays, hashes, puts, gets, conditionals and loops.

Next I will talk about classes using my code as an example. 

The last part I have suggested exercises for people to work on. This involves things like writing extra classes, creating custom comparators or gameplay tweaks. At this stage, just being on hand to answer questions and sit down with people would be much appreciated.

## The code

All the code we will be using is in this repo. The master branch is the full code, the shell branch is what the attendees will be working on. The slides are in the slides.md and go into much of the detail of what we will cover.
